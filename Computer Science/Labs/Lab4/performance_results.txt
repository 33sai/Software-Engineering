SPEED TEST RESULTS (100 runs):

Total time: 536.48 milliseconds
Average per run: 5.36 milliseconds

WHAT THIS MEANS:
- Our code is pretty fast!
- Each run takes about the same time
- Reading/writing files takes most of the time
- The actual data processing is quick

The speed test shows our manual parsing works well
and doesn't get slower over multiple runs.
